  title: PEV Solar Powered Charging Hubs
  imageUrl: /images/PEV.png
  description: Project developed during my QUEST Honors 190H class. Worked in a multidisciplinary team to go through the quality design process of creating a sustainable product that has a small change with large impact. Our team created a solar powered personal electric vehicle (PEV) charging hub to be placed on college campuses. Our team ideated, “rethinked” our solution, calculated financial analysis, pitched our product in a presentation, and created a design proposal for the product. Learned the valuable skills of design thinking, teamwork, project management, and collaborating in a multidisciplinary team.

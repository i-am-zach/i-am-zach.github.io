Hello and welcome to my space!

Originally from Deerfield, IL, I'm a dynamic and forward-thinking Computer Science student at the University of Maryland, College Park. Set to graduate with my Bachelor's degree in an impressive 3 years, I've dedicated myself to pushing the boundaries of what's possible both in and outside of the classroom. In addition to my academic pursuits, I serve as the president of the University of Maryland club volleyball team, managing, running tournaments, and traveling for a thriving community of over 100 members.

While my educational journey has been fast-paced, it has never been one-dimensional. Beyond my CS degree, I'm proud to be part of the QUEST Honors Program, an elite and interdisciplinary program that bridges the gap between business, engineering, and science. I've cultivated a deep understanding of innovation, quality management, and teamwork here — values I take into every endeavor.

During my collegiate journey, I've had the opportunity to wear many hats (in a lot of cool places):

- 2nd Software hire at a MedTech startup, CraniUS (**Baltimore, MD**).
- Technology consultant in the FinTech sector at Ernest & Young (**New York, NY**).
- Frontend Developer at an IRA transfer startup (**Chicago, IL**).

My experiences have provided me with an extensive toolkit:

- Led the launch of a mobile app from idea to execution.
- Designed secure communication protocols for medical devices
- Streamlined sever data processes and ETL workloads

Alongside these roles, I've freelanced, converting ideas into functional software solutions for diverse sectors:

- Media (Hindi88.fm).
- Automotive (Dawson’s Detailing and MatRx).

One project that remains close to my heart is WaveLi, a social networking endeavor I co-founded. Here, not only did I lead the technical launch, but I also oversaw design and recruitment, securing significant funding and resources in the process.

You'll find that my technical proficiencies are varied, from Python to React, with a special love for developing efficient and user-friendly applications. But beyond the code, what truly drives me is my passion for leveraging technology to solve real-world problems, a pursuit I find endlessly rewarding.

If you're seeking someone who marries technical expertise with a strategic mindset and strong leadership capabilities, I'd be eager to connect. Let's bring innovation to the forefront, together.

Thank you for taking the time to learn more about me. Feel free to explore my projects and experiences further on this site or [drop me an email](mailto:zachlefko@gmail.com) for any opportunities or collaborations.

Warm regards,

Zach Lefkovitz.

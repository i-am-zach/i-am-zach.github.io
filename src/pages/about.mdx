<div class="text-2xl uppercase font-bold">EDUCATION & EXPERIENCE.</div>

I am currently a computer science student at the <span class="text-red-500">University of Maryland</span>, where I have received the prestigious President's Scholarship and am a member of the competitive QUEST Honors Program. My coursework includes a range of topics such as data science, algorithms, programming languages, computer systems, and more.


I have gained practical experience through a number of internships and entrepreneurial ventures. At <span class="text-blue-400">CraniUS</span>, I worked as a software developer intern and led projects to automate and standardize server deployments and increase data visibility through a full-stack web application. I also co-founded and served as CTO of <span class="text-green-700">WaveLi</span>, a startup that developed and launched an MVP IOS mobile application and website in just three months. In addition, I have interned as a frontend web developer at <span class="text-green-300">Manifest</span> and continue to support software operations at a Chicago Hindi radio station, <span class="text-blue-200">Hindi88.fm</span>.

<div class="text-2xl uppercase font-bold">SKILLS.</div>

My favorite language to program in is <span class="text-blue-400">Python</span>. I’ve used Python extensively with Django to build backend web applications and with Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for data analysis and visualization. I’m interested in learning how to use Python for machine learning.

Another proficient language is <span class="text-yellow-400">TypeScript</span>. I’ve used TypeScript to build fast and secure frontend web application. My favorite JavaScript framework are Svelte, React, Next.js, Express, Prisma, and TanStack Query.

In educational settings, I TA’d for a class in <span class="text-red-500">Java</span> and have completed courses in <span class="text-[#FAA161]">Rust</span>, <span class="text-blue-600">C</span>, <span class="text-orange-600">OCaml</span>, and <span class="text-red-500">Ruby</span>.

Through my experience with CraniUS and Manifest, I’ve honed my skills in AWS and Cloud Computing. With CraniUS I’ve created and deployed dockerized full-stack web application with full continuous integration and continuous delivery through AWS ECS and ECR.

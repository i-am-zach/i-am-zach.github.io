Close to two years ago today, in the Price Fredrick dorm at the University of Maryland, I along with two other friends signed a piece of paper forming a company called Vntr. The two other co-founders, Samai and Rob, were part of a program at Maryland called ACES which is how they knew each other. Rob had come up with the idea for the startup and told Samai. Neither Samai or Rob were technical guys so they needed a developer to bring their concept to execution.

Sitting here today, writing about WaveLi comes with mixed feelings. The period of time over Summer 2022 when I was working 9 hour days for my internship and then going back home to work another 4 hours on WaveLi was one of the most difficult periods of my life. It almost made me quit coding. I was so busy all the time that I didn't have any time for the people that mattered in my life.

At the same time, the experience building WaveLi introduced me to some amazing people and a beautiful entrepreneurship community at the University of Maryland.

# The Idea

The idea for WaveLi came from the CEO, Rob. College Campuses are a hub for events. All the different organizations on campus are always running events every week and want as many people to attend them as possible. Event discoverability was the issue. To stay in the loop with all events happening, a student would have to join multiple GroupMe groups, discord servers, instagram pages, email newsletters, and other 3rd party apps. A centralized platform for all campus events would benefit both University organizations and students. For organizations, it'd be an easy way to get attention and increase head count at events. For students, it'd make it easier for students to find clubs and events that interest them. However, WaveLi had a twist. The type of people who are most likely to want to attend these events are students without established friend groups, namely freshman and transfer students. WaveLi would allow students to view all the events happening on campus, select the ones they'd be interested in, and be matched with people to attend events with.
